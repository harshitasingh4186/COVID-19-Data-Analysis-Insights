# COVID-19-Data-Analysis-Insights
This project analyzes COVID-19 data to study global trends, case growth, recovery rates, and fatalities. Implemented in Python (Jupyter Notebook), it includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualizations, and trend forecasting to understand the pandemic's impact over time.
<br>
<br>
🔍 Overview:
<br>
This project focuses on analyzing COVID-19 trends worldwide using real-world data. The study includes case progression, mortality rates, vaccination impact, and predictive modeling to provide data-driven insights into the pandemic.
<br>
<br>
📂 Files Included:
<br>
📜 Corona Data Analysis.ipynb – A Jupyter Notebook performing data cleaning, analysis, and visualization of COVID-19 trends.
<br>
<br>
🛠 Project Workflow:
<br>
1️⃣ Data Preprocessing & Cleaning 🧹
<br>
Handling missing values and inconsistencies in COVID-19 records.
Converting dates into time-series format for trend analysis.
<br>
<br>
2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 📊
<br>
Tracking daily and cumulative COVID-19 cases, deaths, and recoveries.
Analyzing fatality and recovery rates by country and region.
Studying vaccination impact on case reductions.
<br>
<br>
3️⃣ Visualization & Trend Analysis 📈
<br>
Line charts, bar graphs, heatmaps, and geospatial maps of COVID-19 spread.
Identifying waves of infections and lockdown effects.
<br>
<br>
4️⃣ Predictive Modeling & Forecasting 🤖
<br>
Using time-series forecasting (ARIMA, Prophet) to predict case surges.
Applying machine learning models for severity classification.
<br>
<br>
🎯 Applications:
<br>
🌍 Global Pandemic Insights – Track case trends and policy effectiveness.
<br>
